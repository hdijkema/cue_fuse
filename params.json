{"name":"MP3 Cue Fuse","tagline":"A fuse file system, using mp3split to display cuesheet driven files as tracks. ","body":"### welcome to MP3 Cue Fuse\r\n\r\nWith Mp3 Cue Fuse, you can mount your mp3 files with cuesheets (e.g. created with [EAC](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/)) as a fuse file system. This is especially interesting for working with cuesheets/mp3 files on OSX. You're able to see your large album files as tracks. A nice feature of it is, that you can import these tracks in iTunes (better not to copy them to the library). iTunes will see and play your music as individual tracks. Better: it will analyse your tracks and provide gapless playback. [test](test)\r\n\r\n### Downloading\r\n\r\n* [Mp3CueFuse version 0.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cuefuse/files/)\r\n\r\n### Installation on OSX\r\n\r\n#### Step 1 - Make sure OSX Fuse is installed \r\n\r\nAlso make sure you install the 'MacFuse' compatibility layer! See [The OSXFuse site](http://osxfuse.github.com/)\r\n\r\n#### Step 2 - Download Mp3CueFuse DMG and open it\r\n\r\nAfter you opened it, drag MP3CueFuse to your Applications folder. \r\n\r\n![Opened MP3CueFuse DMG](http://i.imgur.com/2PuF5Qd.png)\r\n\r\n#### Step 3 - Close the dmg again\r\n\r\n![Closing the DMG again](http://i.imgur.com/J58bEuA.png?1)\r\n\r\n#### Step 4 - Start the application\r\n\r\nIt will run a simple setup procedure, with which you can configure you Mp3CueFuse source directory. With this source directory, the mountpoint ~/CueMusicTracks is setup. Let's have a look. Step one just tells you what's going to happen.\r\n\r\n![Step 1](http://i.imgur.com/QaZFEgc.png)\r\n\r\nStep two, let's you select your source directory. The directory where your cuesheet driven music collection is:\r\n\r\n![Selecting the source directory](http://i.imgur.com/cvOT3NJ.png)\r\n\r\nThe last step tells you that the tracks in source directory can be found in your home directory:\r\n\r\n![Step 3](http://i.imgur.com/0juGxwH.png)\r\n\r\n### Step 5 - Look at the newly created mountpoint.\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at what just happened. You now have read only music tracks. You can't edit them; edit the original files instead if you want to change anything. So this is what we saw before starting the application:\r\n\r\n![before](http://i.imgur.com/7rvkoly.png)\r\n\r\nAnd now, we can browse to a \"directory\" with tracks. This is what you see after running Mp3CueFuse. See the mountpoint (CueMusicTracks)?\r\n\r\n![After](http://i.imgur.com/w6neP7g.png)\r\n\r\nLet's see how the tracks look. Note these tracks have album art in it, because we added album art with [EasyTag](http://marcoschuh.de/wp/?page_id=411) to the *original* mp3 files in the Music/CueMuziek directory.\r\n\r\n![Tracks in finder](http://i.imgur.com/43C1V89.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the result after importing them into iTunes. Note. I prevent iTunes from putting the tracks in the local iTunes library.\r\n\r\n![Tracks added to iTunes](http://i.imgur.com/W1fyBLn.png)\r\n\r\nWell, that's all there's to it. Note. This software is *beta* quality. So, you can expect problems. If so, please post an issue. (large) logs can be found in /tmp/mp3cue.log.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
