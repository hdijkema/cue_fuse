{"name":"MP3 Cue Fuse","tagline":"A fuse file system, using mp3split to display cuesheet driven files as tracks. ","body":"### welcome to MP3 Cue Fuse\r\n\r\nWith Mp3 Cue Fuse, you can mount your mp3 files with cuesheets (e.g. created with [EAC](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/)) as a fuse file system. This is especially interesting for working with cuesheets/mp3 files on OSX. You're able to see your large album files as tracks. A nice feature of it is, that you can import these tracks in iTunes (better not to copy them to the library). iTunes will see and play your music as individual tracks. Better: it will analyse your tracks and provide gapless playback. \r\n\r\n### Downloading\r\n\r\n* [Mp3CueFuse version 0.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cuefuse/files/)\r\n\r\n### Installation on OSX\r\n\r\n#### Step 1 - Make sure OSX Fuse is installed \r\n\r\nAlso make sure you install the 'MacFuse' compatibility layer!
