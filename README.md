cue_fuse
========

A fuse file system, using mp3split to display cuesheet driven files as tracks.
Works also on Mac OS X (10.7 tested) with OSXFuse. In Finder, your cuesheets turn
up as tracks and can be imported in iTunes. What's more: iTunes analyses your
tracks and provides gapless playback.

This fuse system relies on libmp3splt >=v0.8.2
